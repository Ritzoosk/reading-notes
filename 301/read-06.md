## Hello, World!

- ECMAScript 2015 (ES6) ?

- less compatibility issues
- npm = package manager
- local package install "npm init -y"

## Async
- its instead of being bogged down node sets a callback to process other incoming request without need more threads or servers.
- there are cloning strats for scaling capabilites.apps

- good for API/databases
- good boilerplates
- fast and scalable
- can make ROBOTS!
