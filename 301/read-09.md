# Functional Programming
- Balancing speed and readability is key
- if you can get your code to read semantically using good varible names this greatly improves the quality of your code in regards to readability.
- 
- referential transparency: same input = same output
- Functions can be passed and used as data
- Higher-order function are those that use multiple functions to resolve results
- Side-Effects: are unintended outputs and inconsistent data
- functions taking in variable data are not "pure functions"


# Refactoring
- detemanistic: same input same output
- immutable: cant change after its made
- suff with random is not immutable
