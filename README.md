###  About me
I am Ted Knecht I love  **VR**. I enjoy 3D printing and prototyping in my off time. I have a 6 year old son who is pretty excited to learn to code as well, once I explained how Minecraft was made and what "Mods" are :laughing:
I did nearly 11 years in the Navy as an avionic technician, did one depolyment on board a carrier to the Persian Gulf and another to a shore station in Misawa, Japan :jp:
