# 5 Whys

- Developed by Sakichi Toyoda (Toyoda Ind. 1930s)
- Go and see philosophy.
- not Ideal for hi complexity or critical issues, these problems may require more cause/effect/failure mode type analysis
- Good for T/S'ing, QA, work arounds, etc.

### How to use the 5 Whys

- Assemble a team
  - Assign a focus facilitator
- Define the Problem
- Ask why
  - Collect answeres
- Ask why 4 more times seeking subsequent reasons
- Know when you've gone far enough
