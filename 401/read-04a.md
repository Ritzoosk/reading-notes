# Linked List
- It a series of node (nodes contain val:data pair as well as a pointer value [usually points to the next node and indicates its value])
- these lists can be linked
  - singly
  - doubly (both ways)
  - circularly (divide by zero)
- the head property indicates the "beginning" of the link list
- data nodes have to be traversed sequentially
- a "next" value of "NULL" indicates the end of a linked list
