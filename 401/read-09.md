# Stacks & Queues

Sound a lot like a link list?

### FILO - First In Last Out
### LIFO - ^^reverse

## The Stack
It looks to operate like a link list accept your working on the active end of the stack or the (tail).

Also I find it a bit odd that the term "head" is used when it is so closely related to data storage and the active component(or location) of a storage system (i.e. HDD). Strange no?

## Push
- Push is O(1)
- adds value to the stack pointing to the previous value
- then it is set to "new Top"

## Pop
- selects top node and "removes" it for processing and completetion

## Peek
- simply chekcing the stack to see whats there and maybe also whats "next"

## IsEmpty
- yeah what is says. 

# The Queue
- FiFo
- LiLo

## Enqueue
- Add to the stack. the first becoming the "rear"

## Dequeue
- to Pull of the stack the node at the Front

## Front
- active end of the stack with.

## Rear
- starting point of the stack

## Peek
- to check whats next, usually you check isempty first

## IsEmpty
- using the next value it checks to see if there is another value in the stack
