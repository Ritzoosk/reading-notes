# Event Driven Applications

### Why is access control important?
- Your software and systems have and or contin valuable data or methods. These should be protected from bad actors as well as less malicious "bad Actors"

### Describe an application that would need access control.
- A customer database

### What is a role used for?
- To allow users to have access or be restricted from doing or seeing certain things.

### Why is role based access control more scalable than discretionary or mandatory access control?
- Because these permissions are dynamic. They can be given or taken away and this can help respond to security attacks.


# Terms

## Authorization
- I am who I say I am, and here is proof.

## Role base access control
- Persmissions pertaining to modification of assets and data are alloted based on role i.e. admin, user.

## Capabilities
- Capabilities are the actions that are allowed by a user BASED on the their ROLE.




### Which 3 things had you heard about previously and now have better clarity on?
- Credential tokens and routing
- Event listenters

### Which 3 things are you hoping to learn more about in the upcoming lecture/demo?
- removeListeners/ adding
- event.preventDefault()
- eventTarget

### What are you most excited about trying to implement or see how it works?
- Im really excited to see the live interactions you can generate using an event system.
