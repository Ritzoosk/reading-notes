# Data Modeling

Name 3 advantages to Test Driven Development
- Test are ultimately how a products viability is proven so starting with test driven performance results in a smoother dev cycle
- Defining features in tests communicates the nature of the feature across other devs in another way other than UML, design documents, etc.
- less need to spend time on manual tests

In what case would you need to use beforeEach() or afterEach() in a test suite?
- for testing prep and clean up

What is one downside of Test Driven Development
- Changes to the project must be made into test first

Whatâ€™s the primary difference between ES6 Classes and Constructor/Prototype Classes?
- The syntax and scope

Why REST?
- waiting for hits is efficient.

## Preview

Which 3 things had you heard about previously and now have better clarity on?
- TDD, Jest, OOP

Which 3 things are you hoping to learn more about in the upcoming lecture/demo?
- OOP, Data Model, super

What are you most excited about trying to implement or see how it works?
- super, more classes, and writing a test, then the code!
